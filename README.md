# prophet-challenge
## Introduction
This class challenge was to lean into data visualization and analysis, then use Prohpet to predict the future of the data that I was working with. This was accomplished through exercises that required the class to:
* Create a repository in GitHub
* Find unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic
* Mine the search traffic data for seasonality
* Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns
* Create a time series model with Prophet

## Results
This exercise was well built and allowed for me to exercise items I have already learned and to revisit concepts that I had not fully grasped prior to this effort. 

## References
I completed this exercise by accessing the following resources:
* In class materials, slides, and class recordings
* Research in google, StackOverFlow, etc.
